It also has Widevine DRM support and quality of life tweaks such as:
* Native titlebars, even on 10 and 11
* ephemeralViolette's Native controls patch is built into the browser
* The hidden new tab wallpaper feature is enabled
* Lots of privacy tweaks
* No more ads on the new tab
* `about:config` has a more classic feel to it
